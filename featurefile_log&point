//on git, our designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our master (production) branch.
//saved changes are called commits
//Click the Pull Request tab, then from the Pull Request page, click the green New pull request button...When you’re satisfied that these are the changes you want to submit, click the big green Create Pull Request button.
//In this final step, it’s time to bring your changes together – merging your readme-edits branch into the master branch.
